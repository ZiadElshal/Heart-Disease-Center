## ***Project Aims*** 
The Cardiology Center project aims to create a windows-based system with the following key features:

- Homepage: The project begins with a homepage accessible to receptionists. This homepage serves as the central hub for managing the center's operations.

- Receptionist Registration: Receptionists can register on the platform. Upon registration, they gain access to specific administrative privileges.

- Office Management: Receptionists can add and manage doctors and nurses within specific offices. This feature ensures that each office has an organized and dedicated healthcare team.

- Patient Registration: Receptionists can add patients to the system. This functionality allows for efficient patient management, including keeping track of their medical history and appointments.

- Doctor-Patient Connection: Once a patient is registered, they can be linked to a specific doctor who will be responsible for their care. This association ensures personalized medical attention.

- Patient Follow-Up: Doctors have the ability to add special follow-up notes or instructions for each patient under their care. This feature is crucial for providing ongoing medical treatment and tracking patient progress.

In summary, the Cardiology Center project aims to streamline the management of a cardiology clinic by providing a user-friendly platform for receptionists to register, manage healthcare professionals and patients, and facilitate doctor-patient interactions, including personalized follow-up care. This system enhances the efficiency and organization of the cardiology center's operations.
